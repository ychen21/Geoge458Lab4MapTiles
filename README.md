# Geoge458Lab4MapTiles
## Introduction
This project created a web map made up of a base map(from mapbox) and four tile maps,  mapping the hospital locations in Washington State and Seattle Area with different themes(day, night, and a sunset blue theme). The zoom levels of the tiles started at 3 and reach 14 at maximum. 

The first tile set is a basemap of Seattle area.   
The second tile set maps the locations of hospitals in Seattle area in a light mode.  
The third tile set maps the location of hospitals in Seattle area in a darker mode, making the hospitals more prominent in the picture and easier to tell the location.
The fourth tile set maps the Seattle in a special theme I called the sunset theme. In this theme, the roads are way easier to spot because of their color. The map is made up only blue and yellow, making the hospital locations way easier to tell while making other components like location and parks easier to see, too.
